"""The tokens the batch write guard compares: values a write quotes that only a
call's result or an earlier message could supply.

A token is a sha or another hex id, a Kiro Crew item, session or artifact id, a
long run, review or job id, or a PR number written as one (a hash and digits,
or a ``pull/`` path). A clock time is not a token, since a model stamps its own
reports with one; a time to the second counts only as proof (:func:`times_of`).
Kept apart from :mod:`kiro_crew.acp.batch_guard`, whose glob matcher must stay free
of regular expressions.
