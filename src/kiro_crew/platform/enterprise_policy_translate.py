"""Turn the control plane's enterprise-management policy into a Kiro Crew policy document.

The policy arrives as Trust V2 YAML: ``rules: [{capability, effect, match | exclude,
when?}]``, already resolved for the ``CREW`` client surface. Kiro Crew governs only the
capabilities in :data:`MANAGED`; every other capability belongs to another client and
is ignored. A rule on a meta-capability (``all``, ``builtin``, ``filesystem``) reaches
each managed capability beneath it (:func:`_meta_children`).

Per managed capability with a resource the rules reduce to one Crew ruleset, because a
Crew ruleset has one mode (allow-list or deny-list). A capability any rule names is
governed: as the policy language reads it, what no ``allow`` grants is denied.

* ``deny``/``ask`` with neither ``match`` nor ``exclude``: nothing is allowed (``allow []``);
* ``deny``/``ask`` with ``exclude E``: only ``E`` is allowed (several excludes intersect).
  The control plane sends one beside every grant, so it says what is allowed;
* ``allow`` with ``match L`` and no such ``exclude``: ``L`` is allowed;
* ``allow`` with no ``match`` and no such ``exclude``: everything is allowed, so the
  rules become a deny-list of the ``deny match`` entries (empty when there are none);
* ``deny``/``ask`` with ``match L``: ``L`` is taken out of the allowed set;
* a capability rules name but nothing grants: nothing is allowed.

An ``allow`` with ``when`` or with ``exclude`` grants nothing here: the reply is already
resolved for this user, so neither shape is expected, and dropping a grant only
narrows. A ``deny`` with ``when`` applies as if unconditional, which also only narrows.
A pattern that is exactly ``*`` covers every resource.

Each row converts a policy pattern into the patterns its Crew scope's matcher reads
(:attr:`Managed.convert`). A pattern with no exact Crew form is dropped from an allowed
set, which narrows, and widened in a denied set, which also narrows. A denied pattern
that cannot be widened safely refuses the policy (:class:`Unrepresentable`).

A denied glob removes the allowed literals it matches. A denied entry inside an allowed
glob, or a denied glob beside an allowed glob, has no one-mode form. The translation
refuses it with :class:`Unrepresentable` rather than widen or narrow the set, so the
fetch fails. Entries compare as the row's Crew matcher compares them. ``ask`` reads as
``deny``. A managed capability no rule names is left out of the document, so the
enterprise baseline holds (off, or Crew's default for an open control).

A ruleset row may carry a floor: entries its Crew scope never forbids
(``approval_modes`` keeps ``normal``, ``trust`` and ``trust_reads``). They are added to
an allowed set and taken out of a denied one, because the scope refuses a policy that
forbids one.

An on/off capability (one with no resource) reduces to ``{"enabled": bool}``
instead, by :func:`switch`:

* any ``deny``/``ask``: ``enabled: false``;
* an ``allow`` and no deny: ``enabled: true``;
* no rule: unnamed, so the enterprise baseline holds (Crew's default for an open
  control such as ``cron``);
* a rule with ``match``, ``exclude`` or ``when``: ``enabled: false``. The policy language
  refuses ``match`` and ``exclude`` on an on/off capability, and the grant shape the control
  plane sends for one is not confirmed yet, so a shape this module does not know turns the
  capability off rather than guess. Leaving it unnamed would keep an open control on.

The reply's settings (``body.configuration``) arrive beside the policy. Each entry's
``value`` is the setting serialized as JSON. One setting is read today, by
:func:`sandbox_floor` (RFC D7): ``crew_sandbox_min_level`` becomes the floor
``sandbox.min_level``, tighten-only. ``cc`` and ``strict`` set the floor. ``off`` and
``standard`` set none, the same as no entry: Crew's own default already runs at
``standard``, and the sandbox enforcer treats any floor as a governed host, so a floor
that adds nothing would still change behaviour. Any other value is not a level the
organisation picked, so it sets none either and logs a warning: Crew adds no
strictness of its own. Every other setting is ignored.

A gated row (``subagent``) is a Crew capability switch with an inner list: its ruleset
lands as ``{"enabled": bool, "scopes": {<inner>: ruleset}}`` (:func:`_gate`).
